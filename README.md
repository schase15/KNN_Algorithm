# KNN Algorithm
This repository includes the notebook and accompanying dataset for my blog post titled "Implementing K Nearest Neighbors Algorithm with Basic Python"

Read the full tutorial blog post on my website [here.](http://steventchase.com/2020-07-31-KNN_Algorithm/)

This tutorial walks through an implementation of a K Nearest Neighbors supervised machine learning model using only basic Python. It then uses the popular Titanic dataset to test the algorithm and compare the results to that of Scikit-Learn's KNClassifier model.

In addition, the post explains the theory and derives the mathematical formulas behind KNN.
